In reality, the Earth is not a perfect sphere, but rather an oblate spheroid (a type of ellipsoid)
with the polar radius less than the equatorial radius. Because of this, the acceleration of gravity is not
strictly a constant, but rather is a function of latitude (φ). Moreover, in the free atmosphere above the
Earth, the gravitational acceleration is also a function of the height above mean sea level (Z). Combining
these, the acceleration of gravity (cm sec−2) can be written as a function of the two variables, latitude
(degrees, positive/negative in the northern/southern hemisphere) and height above mean sea level (meters)
in the following form:
g(φ, Z) = 980.6160(1−0.0026373 cos 2φ+5.9×10−6
cos2
2φ)−(3.085462×10−4+2.27×10−7
cos 2φ)Z
+(7.254 × 10−11 + 1.0 × 10−18 cos 2φ)Z
2 − (1.517 × 10−17 + 6 × 10−20 cos 2φ)Z

Compute the acceleration of gravity at the following locations, rounding your answers to eight (8) decimal
places. You may want to use a spreadsheet or a short computer script to make the computations, although
this is not required.

APPM - CU Boulder(a) Boulder’s Baseline Road (latitude 40◦ North), at an elevation of one mile above mean sea level.
(b) 10 km above the North Pole.
(c) Halfway between the equator and the North Pole at mean sea level.
(d) 10,000 feet above mean sea level at the Antarctic Circle (≈ 66.5) degrees South latitude. Note that
latitudes south of the equator are negative.)
(e) For a particular Z, is the value of g obtained from this model the same at latitude φ as at latitude −φ?
Why? (Consider both a mathematical and physical answer).
